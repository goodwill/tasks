A simple todo list application written in RubyMotion

This is my toy project with demo on a few things I felt useful to learn coding iOS app using RubyMotion:

1. MagicalRecord: The best ActiveRecord alternative, written with CoreData in mind
2. Motion_Migrate: Avoid the XCode hassle to generate CoreData Schema

A few more libraries has included (sweettea, teacup, sugarcube) but I still haven't really apply this to the project. Feel free to fork and enrich the project.
